Read NISAR L2 GUNW products into line-of-sight displacement.

    unwrapped phase  ->  LOS displacement (mm)
    coherence        ->  quality gate
    connectedComponents -> unwrapping-reliability gate
    AOI polygon      ->  spatial clip
    reference region ->  removes the arbitrary phase offset

Why paths are discovered, not hardcoded
=======================================
NISAR L2 went public in 2026 and the group layout has moved between product
versions. Rather than hardcode /science/LSAR/GUNW/grids/... and fail on a
version bump, this walks the file and finds datasets by name. Run --inspect
on your first file to see exactly what was found and confirm it is sane.

Sign convention
===============
    d_los = -(lambda / 4*pi) * unwrapped_phase

Positive = motion AWAY from the satellite (range increase). For a descending
pass on a west-facing slope that usually reads as downslope motion, but ALWAYS
confirm against a known signal before interpreting. Use --flip-sign if your
convention is the opposite.

Unwrapped phase is RELATIVE. It carries an arbitrary constant per connected
component, so an absolute displacement number is meaningless until you
reference it to something you believe is stable. --ref-lat/--ref-lon does that.
Without a reference the script warns and reports relative values only.

Usage
-----
    python gunw_reader.py --inspect FILE.h5
    python gunw_reader.py --read FILE.h5 --ref-lat 28.21 --ref-lon 28.55
    python gunw_reader.py --read FILE.h5 --geotiff out.tif --quicklook out.png
    python gunw_reader.py --batch ./nisar_l2 --csv timeseries.csv

Requires: h5py, numpy.  Optional: rasterio + pyproj (GeoTIFF), matplotlib (PNG).

    """
    The fixed output grid for this AOI at this product's posting.

    Why exports were not differenceable
    ===================================
    Each export used to be clipped to the bounding box of its own VALID pixels,
    which is a different rectangle in every product - 179x220 for one GUNW pair
    over this AOI and 181x142 for the next. Two rasters of the same ground at
    different sizes cannot be subtracted, so coherence-change mapping, the
    standard way to map a landslide after the fact and the method this project's
    own method notes recommend for it, was unreachable from the pipeline. Every
    comparison in the analysis had to crop to a common extent by hand, which is
    an invitation to a half-pixel error nobody would notice.

    So the grid is defined by the AOI, not by the data. Cell edges are anchored
    to absolute multiples of the pixel size in the projected CRS, and the AOI
    bounds are snapped outward onto them. Any two products in the same CRS at
    the same posting therefore produce byte-for-byte comparable rasters: same
    origin, same size, same pixel centres, with nodata wherever a particular
    product had nothing.

    The anchoring is what makes it work. Snapping to the AOI bounds alone would
    still drift, because the AOI corner is not generally a whole number of
    pixels from anywhere. Anchoring to multiples of `res` gives every product
    the same lattice to land on.

    Returns None when the product grid is not itself aligned to that lattice,
    because the only ways forward from there are to resample - which invents
    values - or to stop. Stopping, loudly, is the better one.

    """
    One reference point for the whole stack, valid in every pair.

    Why this is not optional
    ========================
    --auto-ref picks the best block independently for each interferogram, and
    the inversion then sums those differences as though they shared a datum.
    They do not. Pair A may be referenced 8 km north-west and pair B 5 km
    south-east, so any differential atmosphere, residual ramp or real motion
    between those two blocks enters the time series as a step at that epoch -
    an artefact of bookkeeping that looks exactly like ground moving.

    SBAS requires a common reference across the stack. That is the whole
    reason the technique works: the arbitrary constant cancels only if it is
    the same constant every time.

    How
    ===
    A first pass reads only the quality layers - mask, coherence, components -
    never the phase, which is the expensive array. It intersects validity
    across every pair and scores blocks by mean coherence, so the chosen point
    is one that survives in all of them rather than one that happened to be
    good in the first. The second pass processes normally with that point
    fixed.

    Returns (lat, lon), or None if no block is valid in every pair - which is
    itself worth knowing, and means the stack cannot be inverted as one.
