The detection floor at a point, not over the AOI.

Why this exists
===============
Every noise floor this project quotes is the MAD scatter of one product over
the whole area of interest. The source polygon is 82 km2. The failure was
localised. Those are not the same measurement, and until this module existed
nobody had checked how different they are.

They are different by a factor of 1.7, and the difference is worst exactly
where it matters. Ascending path 098, GOFF layer2, routine products, in a
13x13 pixel window (about 1 km) centred on the failure point at
28.28771 N 85.52809 E:

    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    median                           19.8         33.4

The marked row is the last ascending interval before the 26 August failure.
Over the AOI it has the LOWEST floor in the entire archive - 8.9 mm/day, the
number that made the published bound look strongest. At the failure point that
same pair has a floor of 34.3 mm/day and only 26 of 169 valid pixels.

The bound survives: nothing measured at the point exceeds even the local floor,
in windows of 250 m, 500 m and 1 km.

But do not quote 33.4 as the bound. It is the median across all eight
ascending pairs, five of them winter pairs from November to January, outside
the seven-week window being bounded. Over that window the three covering
intervals read 40.4, 19.2 and 34.3 at the point, and a bound that holds across
a window is set by its weakest interval. That point has since been shown not
to be a scar; the same measurement at every candidate (--targets) is what
bound.py quotes, and at the candidate at the published elevation the figure is
32.0 mm/day per pixel and 9.2 for a 1 km window median.

The AOI figure of 18.6 understates all of these.

The general lesson, which is the same one this project keeps relearning: a
statistic aggregated over terrain that did not fail describes terrain that did
not fail. An 82 km2 median is a fine description of an 82 km2 area and a poor
description of one hillside inside it.

What "floor" means here
=======================
3 * MAD-sigma of the range offsets in the window, divided by the span in days:
the constant velocity that would have to be present for the pair to see it at
three sigma. Identical definition to goff_reader's AOI-wide
`detect_floor_mm_day`, so the two are directly comparable - the only thing that
changes is which pixels go in.

    Percentile-bootstrap 95% interval for the detection floor.

    Why a floor needs an interval
    ----------------------------
    The floor is 3*MAD-sigma/span, and a MAD from a few dozen pixels is an
    estimate with real sampling error - roughly 15% relative at n = 50, and
    far worse below that. The pre-event pairs that matter most here are the
    ones with the FEWEST valid pixels in the window (26 and 19 of 169), so the
    headline bound rests on exactly the samples where a point estimate is
    least trustworthy. Quoting "40.4 mm/day" to three figures from 49 pixels
    asserts a precision the data does not carry.

    One caveat this interval does NOT cover: GOFF layers come from overlapping
    correlation windows, so neighbouring offset estimates share input pixels
    and are not independent. The effective sample size is smaller than the
    pixel count, so this interval is a LOWER bound on the true uncertainty.
    The error neighbours share is measured separately, by
    block_median_floor(), rather than folded in here.

    """
    The 3-sigma floor on a WINDOW MEDIAN, measured empirically. mm/day.

    detection_floor() answers "what velocity would ONE PIXEL see at three
    sigma". A precursor measured by another instrument is an average over a
    slope, so the fair comparison is against the noise of an averaged
    estimate - and that cannot be had by dividing the per-pixel sigma by
    sqrt(n). GOFF offsets come from overlapping correlation windows, so
    neighbours within a kilometre share most of their error; a scatter
    computed inside one window cannot see the part the whole window shares.

    So measure it directly: tile the field into non-overlapping blocks the
    size of the window, take each block's median, and quote 3 MADs of those
    medians over the span. That includes every error the window median
    actually suffers, correlated or not, and any real motion elsewhere in the
    AOI - so it is an upper bound on the estimator noise, not an idealisation.
    It is AOI-wide by construction; the point-versus-area escalation this
    module exists for applies to it too, and is why it is quoted beside the
    per-pixel local floor rather than instead of it.
