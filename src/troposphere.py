--------------
Measure and remove the elevation-dependent (stratified) tropospheric delay from
exported LOS displacement rasters.

Why this exists
===============
The pipeline removes an ionosphere screen, references to stable ground, and
subtracts a scene median epoch by epoch. None of that touches the term that
matters most in high relief: tropospheric water vapour is stratified with
height, so it perturbs interferometric phase in proportion to elevation. A
median removes the mean, not the gradient.

Measured over the source zone, on the fixed 116x155 export lattice, with a
3-MAD clipped fit (see fit_elevation_trend for why it is not plain least
squares):

    GUNW phase     15 pairs  |r| median 0.46, 21.1% of variance, 13/15 p<0.001
    GOFF offsets   18 pairs  |r| median 0.12,  1.5% of variance, 15/18 p<0.001

A fourteenfold difference in explained variance, which is what the physics
predicts. Phase measures optical path length and is perturbed directly; offset
tracking measures a geometric pixel shift and is affected only at second order.
So the bounded non-detection, which rests on offsets, is largely immune - and
any phase result is not.

Read the variance column, not the slope column. The GOFF slopes are the LARGER
of the two in absolute terms - median 19.1 mm/km against 8.8 for phase, max 90.4
against 21.7 - and that is not a contradiction. Offset fields are one to two
orders of magnitude noisier (MAD 34-470 mm against 8-49 mm for phase), so a
steeper line accounts for a smaller share of what is there. A slope quoted
without the scatter it sits in says nothing.

The decisive detail is not the magnitude either. It is that the fitted slope
ALTERNATES SIGN between consecutive 12-day pairs - 6 reversals in 15 phase
pairs, 10 in 18 offset pairs. Ground does not reverse direction every twelve
days. A water-vapour field does.

What "removing" it means, and what it does not
==============================================
This fits displacement against elevation over the valid pixels of one raster
and subtracts the fitted line. That removes the part of the delay that is
linear in height, which is the stratified component. It does NOT remove:

  - turbulent water vapour, which has no elevation signature,
  - any real deformation that happens to correlate with height, and there is no
    way to tell the two apart from one interferogram.

The second point is the honest limit of the method. A slope that creeps faster
at altitude looks exactly like a stratified delay to this fit. Where that is a
live possibility, report the slope as an error bar instead of removing it -
`--report-only` does that.

There is a third limit, and over this AOI it binds. The pixels that survive
coherence and correlation masking are not spread evenly over the relief: they
sit in a band roughly 1.1 km wide inside a 4.0 km range, so the line is
extrapolated across about 3.4 times the interquartile range on a typical pair.
A fit that reaches that far past its own support is set by a minority of pixels
and applied to all of them. The tool computes range/IQR per pair, flags it in
the table with `!`, and says so in the summary. Ten of fifteen phase pairs and
ten of eighteen offset pairs are flagged here, which is why the source-zone
numbers above are quoted as an uncertainty and NOT removed from the published
time series.

Elevation source
================
SRTM 30 m via OpenTopoData, fetched once per AOI grid and cached to
outputs/dem_cache/. The public endpoint allows one request per second, so a
full 116x155 grid would be 180 requests. Fetching every pixel is unnecessary
for a trend that is smooth by construction, so a decimated grid is fetched and
bilinearly resampled; --step controls it.

    Displacement against elevation, in mm per km.

    Why the fit is robust by default
    --------------------------------
    Plain least squares gave the wrong answer here, and the way it failed is
    worth recording. On a winter ascending pair the displacement field has a
    tight core and heavy tails - MAD scatter 13.8 mm against a standard
    deviation of 39.4, a ratio of 2.9. Least squares minimises the squared
    residual, so the tails set the slope. Removing that slope reduced the
    standard deviation from 39.4 to 34.3, exactly as least squares promises,
    and simultaneously pushed the MAD scatter of the core UP from 13.8 to 22.2.

    The fit was optimising a statistic nobody in this project uses. Every other
    noise figure here is MAD-based, because unculled SAR products are full of
    gross outliers. So this clips residuals at `clip_sigma` MADs and refits,
    twice, which is the same discipline applied to the trend.

    Set robust=False to recover the plain least-squares behaviour - useful only
    for demonstrating the above.

    Pure: no I/O, no raster, so the decision this drives can be tested.
