candidate_check.py
------------------
Interrogate one location before calling it a landslide.

The problem
===========
A per-pixel stack will always produce candidates. Correlated atmosphere makes
clusters, low coherence makes outliers, and an unwrapper faced with a steep
gradient makes cycle errors that are spatially coherent and beautifully
monotonic. Every one of those looks like creep in a single geometry and a
single season.

So a candidate is not a measurement until it survives being attacked from
four directions at once, and this tool runs the attack.

    geometry     does the other orbit see it, at the sensitivity it should?
    season       is it present when the hazard mechanism is active?
    differential is it local, or is it the whole AOI moving together?
    ceiling      is it slower than lambda/4 per pair, i.e. measurable at all?

The seasonality test is the one people skip
===========================================
Himalayan slope creep is monsoon-driven: pore pressure peaks June to
September. A signal that appears in the accumulation season and vanishes
through the monsoon has the seasonality of a snowpack, not a slope. Dry snow
is nearly transparent at L-band, so it preserves coherence while adding a path
delay that scales with accumulated water equivalent - producing a steady,
spatially coherent, high-coherence apparent motion that is not motion.

    Does the pair of line-of-sight rates look like downslope motion, or like a
    path delay?

    Downslope motion has ONE magnitude D. Each track sees D projected onto its
    own line of sight, so

        v_asc = sens_asc * D        v_desc = sens_desc * D

    and the ratio v_desc/v_asc is fixed by geometry alone at sens_desc/sens_asc.
    Where the two sensitivities have opposite signs - which is most of this
    terrain - real motion MUST appear with opposite LOS signs.

    A path delay is not a vector. Atmosphere, or a snowpack, adds the same
    extra path length whichever direction the radar looks from, so it arrives
    with the SAME sign in both geometries and a ratio near +1.

    The previous version of this test had it backwards: it required matching
    signs before declaring a signal real, which is the signature of the thing
    it was meant to exclude. On the Langtang candidate (sens_asc -0.732,
    sens_desc +0.472) both rates are negative, so the old rule called a phase
    artefact "a real phase signal". The verdict there survived only because the
    seasonality test caught it afterwards.

    Returns a dict rather than printing, so the decision can be tested without
    a network round trip for terrain.
