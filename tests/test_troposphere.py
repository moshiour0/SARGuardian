"""
The stratified troposphere fit must not be steered by outliers.

Why this exists
===============
The first version of this fit used plain least squares, and it produced a
result that looked right and was not. On one winter pair it reported a slope of
-23.6 mm/km, removed it, and cut the standard deviation from 39.4 to 34.3 - the
number least squares is built to reduce. At the same time the MAD scatter of the
core, which is the statistic every other noise figure in this project uses,
went UP from 13.8 to 22.2. The fit was pulling the bulk of the field apart in
order to serve a minority of gross outliers, and the summary line said the
correction was working.

Two things had to hold before the tool could be trusted:

  1. a slope fitted on clean data must survive the addition of gross outliers,
     because unculled SAR products always contain them, and
  2. when the fit IS extrapolated - most valid pixels in a narrow elevation
     band, the line reaching far past it - the tool must say so rather than
     silently applying it.

These tests hold both, plus the sign and units of the removal itself.
